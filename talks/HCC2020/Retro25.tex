  \frametitle{A bit of personal (HP-Related) history...}

  \begin{tabular}{p{0.7\textwidth}c}
    \scriptsize
    At age 13 (in 1973) I lived briefly in Leeds, England and worked
    at the Uni as an unpaid physics graduate student.  I encountered an HP-9100 and
    taught myself to program it.  I was immediately hooked! &
    \raisebox{-0.6\height}{\includegraphics[width=1in]{figs/9100aqs.jpg}} \\
    \scriptsize
    In 1975 my father bought an HP-25.
    I devoted myself to delivering the {\em Ann Arbor News}
    faithfully to about 60 subscribers, and eventually I could afford my
    own HP-25 at \$195.00 (about \pounds 663 today) &
    \raisebox{-0.6\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.5in]{figs/hp-25.jpg}} \\
    \scriptsize
    Unfortunately both HP-25 are now dead; mine fell in the fish tank with
    the piranhas while I was away and my roomies were scared to
    retrieve it!  My father's died when the batteries lost contact. &
    \raisebox{-0.6\height}{\includegraphics[width=1in]{figs/piranha.jpg}} \\    
    \scriptsize
    Since then I have become somewhat of a collector, acquiring a 10C,
    11C, 15C, 16C and 67.  The 10C and 15C were filched, the 11C and 16C
    I use almost daily.

  In High School I made the acquaintance of an HP-2100 series
  computer running HP timeshare BASIC.  We played various games
  (some legit, like TREK73) and others (posting the administrator password
  on the chalkboard) not so legit.  &
    \raisebox{-0.8\height}{\includegraphics[width=1in]{figs/hp2100.jpg}} \\
  \scriptsize
  I studied computer science for a while at Michigan and
  became expert with the model 29 (I hated that thing!)
  I did learn a few other things (ALGOL and S/370 assembly) &
    \raisebox{-0.8\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.7in]{figs/punch.jpg}} \\
  \scriptsize
  What really changed my life was working at Radio Shack.
  They introduced the TRS-80 and I immediately bought one
  (well, honestly, I put it on ``lay-a-way'' at my house!)
  I taught myself Z80 assembly language and wrote a simple multi-tasking
  kernel and FORTH system. &
    \raisebox{-0.8\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.7in]{figs/model1.jpg}} \\  
  \scriptsize
  I parlayed my Z80 skills into a job a ETC (theatre lighting)
  and designed their Idea and Vision lighting consoles, and wrote
  much of the low-level software in Z80 assembly (using my trusty
  TRS-80, now decked out with dual 8 inch floppies) as a dev system. &
